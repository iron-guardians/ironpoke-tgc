# IronPoke TGC

**IronPoke TGC** is a collectible card game inspired by classic strategy games like Pokemon. In this project, players engage in tactical battles using customized decks, where each card can represent creatures, abilities, energies, and special actions. The goal is to defeat rival Pokemon and meet specific victory conditions.

## How to Play

The game is played in turn-based matches, where each player must carefully manage their resources and plan their moves. Below are the main phases and mechanics:

### 1. Deck Preparation and Construction
- **Deck Construction:**  Before starting a match, each player builds their deck with various types of cards:  
  - **Pokemon:** Represent the fighters and can evolve to gain new abilities.  
  - **Energies:** Necessary to activate attacks or special abilities.  
  - **Trainers and Support:** Provide strategic effects, allowing you to search for cards, heal damage, or alter the flow of the match.
- **Match Start:** At the beginning of a match, each player shuffles their deck and draws a predetermined number of cards. An active Pokemon is placed on the field to perform attacks, and additional Pokemon can be kept on the bench, ready to join the battle.

### 2. Match Progression
Each turn is divided into several phases:

- **Preparation Phase:**  
  - **Card Draw:** At the start of the turn, the player draws a card from their deck.  
  - **Field Setup:** Players can place energy or additional Pokemon cards, or perform evolution actions if possible.

- **Action Phase:**  
  - **Playing Cards:** The player can deploy energy cards on their Pokemon, use trainer cards to gain strategic advantages, or set up evolutions.  
  - **Strategy and Resources:** Efficient card management is crucial to prepare for attacks and counter the opponent’s moves.

- **Attack Phase:**  
  - **Executing Attacks:** The active Pokemon performs an attack using the accumulated energy. Each attack has a cost and an effect, which may include dealing damage, applying status effects, or triggering special abilities.  
  - **Combat Resolution:** Damage is calculated, effects (such as weakening or paralysis) are applied, and victory conditions are evaluated.

- **End Phase:**  
  - **Turn End:** Once all actions are complete, the turn passes to the next player, allowing the match to continue in alternating fashion.

### 3. Strategic Elements
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently managing energy and available cards is vital; every decision can influence the pace and direction of the match.
- **Planning Moves:** The combination of cards in your deck, anticipating your opponent’s plays, and making informed decisions in each phase are key to success.
- **Customization and Evolution:** Over time, players can improve their decks by adding new cards and refining strategies, leading to a dynamic and ever-evolving experience.

### 4. Game Modes
- **Real-Time or Turn-Based Matches:** Depending on the game’s configuration, battles can be played in real time or on a turn-by-turn basis, allowing players to engage at different paces.
- **Ranking and Statistics:** A ranking system and statistics tracking are implemented to help evaluate performance and refine strategies over time.
